## Open-closed Principle (OCP):
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Decorator
- Factory

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

- Decorator

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
