# How

## Identify distinct responsibilities:
- Ask yourself, “What would cause this class to change?” If there are multiple, independent answers, those are separate responsibilities.

## Extract responsibilities into separate classes/modules:
- Create new, focused classes or modules for each identified responsibility.

## Ensure each new entity has only one reason to change:
- The goal is that a modification in requirements for one responsibility should only affect one class, not multiple.
