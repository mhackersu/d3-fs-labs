# Why

## More Maintainable:
Easier to understand and fix bugs.

## More Flexible:
Can adapt to changing requirements without significant re-architecting.

## More Extensible:
New features can be added with minimal impact on existing code.

## Easier to Test:
Components can be isolated and tested independently, reducing the risk of side effects.

## Less Prone to Code Smells:
They guide towards cleaner, more organized codebases, preventing the accumulation of bad design choices.
