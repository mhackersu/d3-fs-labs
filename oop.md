# OOP

## The Single Responsibility Principle:
- Can be applied to functions, modules, microservices, or even entire teams.
- Open/Closed (OCP) Desirable in any architectural style.

## Liskov Substitution (LSP):
- Applies to polymorphic relationships, regardless of the language’s specific features.

## Interface Segregation (ISP):
- Sub-divides large contracts into smaller, more client-specific ones, which is valuable even in functional programming or service design.

## Dependency Inversion (DIP):
- Encourages decoupling through abstractions, a crucial concept in many architectural patterns like hexagonal architecture or clean architecture, which aren’t exclusively OOP. Therefore, while their origins are in OOP, the SOLID principles offer timeless wisdom for designing robust and maintainable software systems across various paradigms and scales.
